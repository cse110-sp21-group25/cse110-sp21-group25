**Team 21**
- Got the calendar started and the sidebar opens and closes functionally.
- Updated their hi-fi. 
- Weekly log has a weekly review checklist and what you learned last week. Also a spot for personal development. 
- Posting meme's from storage as well on most of their pages.
- Daily Log has a lot going on. A tracker to show what day of the week it is and a little sticky note showing what the date currently is on the left. Then the actual note taking portion is centered. 
- D: Be careful doing long form note taking on top of small notes. The level of complexity gets much more complicated. 


**Team 27**
- When clicking to create a new Focus Item a pop up shows up with all the options to create a new focus item. 
- Have a lot of very specific parts moving around. 
- D: Come up with a plan that is a version 1 that we work on until completion before moving onto more complicated features. Just want to be careful that we will be able to have a finished project at the end of the 3.5 weeks we have left. Some more complicated features are going to potentially take a long time.


**Team 22**
- Assigned each person components to work on so there hasn't been too much progress yet this week. 
- Simplified the settings page a lot. Font will only change the daily log portion. All the other componenets have their own font that is set.
- D: Maybe add the settings page as a v2 feature since the app could work as intended without it. Use that sort of thought process to pick what to actually work on and such.
- D: You can have some team members focusing on the individual components as well as someone else setting up the skeleton. Skeleton adding some minimal styling to be a rough skeleton of where everything will end up in the end. Helps so that you have a place to place all the components once they are ready. 


**Team 26**
- Very basic, keeping it simple. 
- Scrolldown all on one page. 
- Planning on sorting the tasks by importance. 
- D: Maybe add stressed out, angry, or worried to the modd tracker too potentially. Check out the wheel of emotions for some inspiration. https://fairygodboss.com/career-topics/emotion-wheel


**Team 23**
- Mood tracker with some algorithm to chart their progress within a graph.
- Added specific shapes for priority of tasks. 
- Future Log, allow you to input the important stuff for each month. Allow you to migrate that into specific weeks and days if you would like. 
- D: Waiting on the month view and say that it is coming later instead. Focus on the other screens for now to get a minimum viable product going. 
- D: Suggestion is to have the yearly calendar just stubbed out as a coming soon feature or something at first. 
- D: In a zoomed out view you should be able to see priority things rather then everything. Just think about what you would want to see when looking at a month or year view, you wouldn't necessarily want to be overwhelmed by absolutely everything visible. 
- Team is using Heroku for distribution. 


**Team 25**
- First show us the skeleton. A nice spot to park our components. 
- D: Make sure that we understand the code we are writing in from CodePen. 
- D: Create a sort of blog to talk about the things that we get done each week. Sort of tell a story of the things we worked on and how it ended up going. Including any links and such of what we used to get there. 


**Team 24**
- Same sort of layout from last week. Added the stickers throughout the entire page.
- D: We talked about responsive design last time. Any updates on that? 
- The stickers are more of an extended feature. 
- They have a nice light blue on white color theme throughout the entire app.
- Cool 3D book as the opening page.
- D: Get the book to open up to show you what you can do to keep with the aesthetic.

#### Overall Advice:
- D: We should go to office hour again next Monday to get some feedback on the skeleton and any of the components. 
-  D: People underestimate the power of simplicity. Keeping it simple is make it easier to understand for the user. 
- D: If your features are being chosen by some scientific fact or study then make sure to include that in the ADR's and such. 
- D: Go forward in steps so that we will have something to "ship" at the end.
