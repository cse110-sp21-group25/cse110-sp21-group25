# Notes from professor
- A lot of good stuff it's just a little more polished, trim and focused.
  - Left side, make the name larger. Index was too big. 
  - Make the index into a tray so that it can go in and go out. 
  - Is cluttering a little bit, a fair mental load going on. 
  - The middle looks good however we should relook at left and right side. 
    - Weekly and Monthly reminders might be a lot, maybe hide things so that it isn't directly always taking your view. 
    - Each little thing is a birdy chirping at you, how many should we really have in here should be more thought out to keep that mental load down.
  - Exclamation point is usually interpreted as important or danger. (Instead we have it as a help, maybe update it to be a question mark with the help button.)
  - Settings is a typical icon, don't know if it is in a typical position 
  - Need to update the time and dates. 
  - Navigational controls are kind of out of place. Think of mouse control/movement. They will be within the middle mostly but have to travel all the way over to the right to move to another days. Should maybe put the arrows and navigation near the date in the middle.
  - Mood tracking is nice but a little big. (maybe scale it down) Think of size as loudness of voice, keep things big that really need a loud voice. What jumps our out you the most. 
  - Calendar view is really nice. Maybe add a toggle like on a mac that will allow the calendar to get bigger or look at some examples and borrow from them to help with some inherited knowledge for the user. Help it look like something they already know to help lower their mental burden.
  - Think about using a consistent 
  - Our job is to keep the user from going to the rage level. 
  - Nothing we did was necessarily wrong but we should rethink the organization in order to help keep that rage meter low. 
  - If we have heavy icons anywhere like in the right then it should be used everywhere to keep the consistency. 
  - Notifications could be a different color to sort of take some 
  - Generally hiding anything that you don't necesarrily need right now is a good idea. 
    - Is a very delicate balance though. We need to think about our market and the goal of our app. 
    - Simplistic can be lightweight and super fast/easy to use. 
- Idea is to not invent a new type of pizza just keep the quality and maybe add some subtle different ingredients that make your pizza stand out. More then anything we need to execute extremely well since most people don't. 
  - An example is the note taking execution that was shown within class. 
  - The reMarkable tablet is another great example. 
- We are on the right track but we should polish and rearrange it a little more to help it get even better. 
- Up the brand too so that it is more prevalent.
