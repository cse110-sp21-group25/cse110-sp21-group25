## Deepak:

- Looks nice.
- Legend could be a part of the i for information or set it up as a question mark.
- Check out calendar plugins to allow you to jump between day to day at least.
- Local storage generally should not take longer then half a day to implement. When there is an onWrite, localStorage.write() and then when you initially open up the page run a localStorage.load().
- Try to get the storage up and a calendar at least to switch between days.
- Polish up the CSS and alignment if we have time.
  - For example, weekly and monthly tab looks a little too close to the top.
  - Maybe move the date inline with the title rather then hugging the left.
- Try to wrap everything up this week due to the fact we mostly have finals week next week.
- This week wrap up the software and tests.
- If we have time this weekend polish up the CSS.
- Next week we will busy making the videos and is advisable to have some end user talks (user guide to our app) and we need to have a new developer walkthrough, what a new developer would need to be brought onboard (How to setup environments and then also explain how the pipeline works and link to supported docs). User manual should be annotated screenshots.
