## Deepak Info
- In order to get the comments from Miro we could open the dev tools and write a quick little JavaScript to grab the comments (side bar comments scroll and message text). 
- Need to work on some wireframing. 
- This week we will be coming up with a pitch and Deepak recommends to read the Shape Up book. 
  - Our pitch should include:
    - Our understanding of the problem
    - How we plan to approach it 
    - Timeline to accomplish 
    - Stretch goals
    - Any extra added features. 
  - 2 specific chapters within the book have everything we will need to do. 

- Can use Figma for our wireframes. 
  - Low Fidelity Wireframe
    - Give us an idea of how we are going to expose those features to the user. 
    - Don't care about the colors, fonts, etc.
    - More important to get a handle on the screens and how it is accessed. Give an overview of the interface and data flow of the application. 
  - From that we can make the High Fidelity Wireframe
    - Positioning as well as UI is more important with this one and buttons are where we want.

**By the end of this week:**
- Have a good idea of what features we want to have. 
- Low Fidelity Wireframe (UX) (How those features are going to be exposed to user, data flow.) Keep it simple. 
  - Once we get this done be sure to send it to Deepak so that he can check it out. We will also present to the other teams next week. 
- High Fidelity Prototype (Pixel Perfect UI, Placing and pixels along with flow needs to be on here in our ideal way)

Monday we need to attend the Professors Office Hour to get some feedback. (Mondays 2-4)
- Familiarity breeds empathy. We want to get feedback but to also interact with the professor so he has seen our project and heard our ideas. 
- Get some feedback. 
- Professor Powell and Camdyn have done an incredible amount of research so they know a lot more than we do so we should use that resource as much as we can. They have also done some prototyping. 

## Questions: 

Issac - Q: Would you recommend using Figma for both wireframes? 
  - Deepak - A: Yes, it works well for both especially since the low wireframe will be a less refined version of the high fidelity wireframe. A good tutorial can be found https://balsamiq.com/learn/, which is another site but older however they have a nice tutorial on wireframing.

## Important Notes:
- Next week we will meet up with the other teams on Monday or Tuesday to discuss project ideas and pitches. Deepak will get back to us with specific times.
- Some of us should go to Professor's office hour next Monday (2-4) with the wireframes and pitch to get feedback. 
- Before tomorrow's meeting we should take a look at the https://balsamiq.com/learn/ to know what we are getting ourselves into.
