- Deepak: Whimsical is good for low fi. https://whimsical.com/ 

**Team 27**
- Cora: It's good to have multiple versions where you build incrementally. 
- Want to make the background images to be more blended in so that it was not as much of a focus. 
- Cora: Pictures are really hard to make work when you add components on top of them. Color contrast can cause some weird issues. 
- Deepak: Background images can be found from either https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/ or https://www.heropatterns.com/ 
- Cora: Backgrounds should be set up and finalized within the polish stage of your project. Make sure not to pick a background that will force the positioning of your components. 

**Team 26**
- Cora: Likes the fact that the first thing that you see is the mood thing. It is centered at the top. It is hard to tell if they are buttons though. (They are currently just faces) 
- Cora: Some kind of way to tell that the faces are clickable. Be careful with what colors you choose since that could be construed as something you didn't intend.
- Cora: Would reccomend making the grid that starts and ends at the same place. Take advantage of your white space.
- Cora: Typography wise if the headers show the hierarchy a bit then you could think about not including the underlines since that could add a little to the cognitive load. 
- Using bootstrap for their site. 

**Team 21** 
- Using calendar API.
- Meme generator on page refresh.
- Daily Log looks like it's also an API, has Bold, Italic, Underline and other options at the top of the journal page.
- Cora: Can make temporary title for the areas that aren't clearly defined at first glance. Temporary title could be replaced by the user if it will fit. 
- Collapsed state of the nav bar still shows the icons and is completely usable just doesn't have full descriptions. 
- Cora: Identify what order of things you would like the user to focus on. Use that to create a path for where you want the user to go. The amount of thinking the user needs to understand your app will be what helps/hurts users view of your app. 

**Team 25**
- Cora: Left navigation bar is standard.
- Cora: Very clear point of entry. Very good that there is a typography hierarchy on the text. 
- Cora: Font sizes being multiples of 8 is usually what is used. Figma already does this automatically.
- Cora: The pound symbol for tags might be redundant. Since the fact that they are already in their respective sense. Maybe if you click the tag it could show all other places that tag is used. 
- Cora: Questioning if the date matters as much as the title or rest of the journal itself. Point of emphasis personally (to Chora) would be the title and the actual content. Wouldn't need as much of a reference about the current day since majority of the time you wouldn't be flipping back and forth. Confused as to why the arrows are next to the date rather then the title. Gives the impression that the day might change but the title wouldn't. Hierarchically the arrows being up at the top on the left and right of the title to show that changes too.
- Cora: Not sure if you need to actually have the dates within the nav bar. Should think about having a larger font for these as well. 
- Cora: Curious as to how we came up with the 2 fonts. One within the nav bar and the other as the actual journal. Recommend keeping the same font or another font pairing. 
- Cora: Whitespace, make sure that it is clear that the whitespace is intentional and not on accident. Could just center the entire middle portion so that the whitespace is split between the left and right of the journal portion itself.
- Deepak: On the nav-bar instead of having the whole week maybe have a rolling basis relative to the current day. Yesterday, today, tomorrow, etc. 
- Cora: Think about the discoverability of icons. The ones at the bottom should be moved up so that they are known from the get go. 
- Deepak: If we do add the clickable tags then do that after our MVP is completed. 

**Team 24**
- Cora: Try to cut down on the number of fonts. Good that you have consistent icons and titles for each. Work on differentiating using different text sizing. 
- Cora: Legend or Symbol guide is nice to have on every single screen since it will help the user reference it at any point. Incorporate it within each page in a universal place. 

**Team 23**
- Cora: Checkboxes look more like a badge that represents what the entry is. Recommend following the convention where most checkboxes are squares. Multiple choice is a circle. Makes it easier for the user so that they don't have to learn a new tool. 
- Cora: If you have something that you want to be pressable, make sure that there is a distinct shape surrounding it to show that it is pressable or look like more like a button. 

**Team 22**
- Cora: Hierarchy, contrast between titles and other things. Make sure the spaces are more proportional and realistic.
- Cora: Today button is nice to pull you back to the current day.
- Cora: Figma probably has some plugin that measures the amount that text disappears within the background and such.
- Cora: Try to lean more towards 2 fonts max. 
- Cora: The fact that the mood disappears after it is chosen feels like some control is taken away from the user.
