## Discussion Items

**Summary:** \
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meeting began with greetings between all team members. The topic for this session was **Brainstorming #2**. All team members were asked to come prepared to discuss about their individual research on the specific examples found of analog/digital 'Bullet Journals.' The activities of this meeting entailed the following:
  - Discuss/Comment on examples of analog Bullet Journals.
  - Discuss/Comment on examples of digital Bullet Journals.
  - Discuss the similarities and differences between analog vs digital Bullet Journals.
    - Discuss their pros and cons
  - Discuss the most important/desired features from users for Bullet Journals to have. 

## Flow:
 - Back and forth suggestions on ideas to fill the blocks
 - Brian posed the question: Are we trying to solve a problem with the existing concept of journals?
 - Decided to use three ideas for Why? #1
 - Formulated concrete ideas thinking and responding as a prospective candidate that could begin to use a 'Bullet Journal.'
 - Reflection on how '5 Why's' was somewhat as ourselves being kids asking:
   - Why did you say this?
   - Our teacher asking: Why did you write that?
 - Finally, we exchanged a few examples of *analog* vs *digital* bullet journals. 


## <u> Analog Bullet Journal Activity </u>
*Concept:* Analog Bullet Journals include physical books, journals, that have the flexibility to be utilized or turned into a Bullet Journal.

Working asynchronously, all team members collaborated in *Miro* to build upon creating a board which consisted in compiling different types of analog Bullet Journal examples. In the synchronous team meeting we discussed and commented on the unique features we saw on each example that was pinned into the 'analog examples' frame. Each example took an estimate of 5 minutes (timer).

| Jesse Wolf    | Nice drawings, lots of colors that look nice within the page </br> Date area up top setup for you. </be> They are using a lot of the different associated with bullet journaling.  </br>This is using graph paper instead of dotted grid | Has all the basic symbols. But leaves space for custom ones as well.                                                                          | Back to dotted grid  </br> ALlows for super nice customization.          </br> Legend with all the normal and custom keys. | Cool that it is sticky notes added on that can be removed when going to the store. </br> Reusable template due to removable stickies. | Line, not dotted                                                                                    |     |     |
| Grady Gabriel | I like how it shows different bullet points which has different meaning.                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                     |     |     |

| Issac Garcia  | One can really add their own personality to it. Can be 'artsy'.                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                               | Key card </br> Mood level                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                       | I have seen journals that utilize the first two pages for index. The index gets constantly updated. |     |     |

## Additional Notes
- For the last two examples, there was not much to note, more of a discussion was taken part on the observations of the differences between these and the past examples.

 ## <u> Digital Bullet Journal Activity </u>
*Concept:* Digital Bullet Journals include applications, websites, and any form of electronic/digital medium that has the flexibility to be utilized or turned into a Bullet Journal.

Working asynchronously, all team members collaborated in *Miro* by adding and compiling different types of digital examples of Bullet Journals. In the synchronous team meeting we discussed and commented on the unique features we saw on each example that was pinned into the 'digital examples' frame. Each example took an estimate of 5 minutes (timer).

## Additional Notes
- Only got through four examples, decided that the rest would be done asynchronously since we were reaching the end of our session. We would continue with discussion were we left of next session. 

---
## Big features that jumped out:
- Costume templates
- Key of symbols (Can add custom too)
- Automated Indexing
- People like adding their mood to their daily pages
-  Notifications to remind you to fill out your day. Ask the user what time they would like to be reminded each day to fill out their journal. 

## Ending remarks:
- Add some notes (Miro)
- Jump in our free time and add comments (Miro)
- We can finish the next activity on next session
- Nothing really due, just Brainstorming
- Suggest what to do asynchronous for those who did not attend
  - Repeat every activity, watch the recording, contribute to the Miro and discussion
  - Notify through Slack
