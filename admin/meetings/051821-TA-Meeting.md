## Deepak:
- Try to use GitHub projects as well as the GitHub issues since due to using Agile we should be doing some sprint planning as well as story points. 
- Rubric is subject to change but will give us an idea of what is expected and what we will be graded on.
- The team seems to be on track. Not sure how far you are within the integration steps. Brian: We have all but 2 of the components added within the skeleton and so shouldn't take too long.
- This weekend should all get together and do the integration into the skeleton so that we can have a MVP out by this upcoming weekend.
- Once student should be focused on testing entirely. Is extremely important for any stable product and for our grade.
- Suggested to use Jest and Cypress since that is what we will be working with for the lab. It will probably be easier for the overall team to be able to read the tests if we use those due to everyone having some visibility. 
- We are "allowed" to work on the project finals week technically but will have plenty of video creation to be doing so it's not advisable.
- Finals week we will need to create 2 videos, one 12 minute one walking through basically how everything works in depth. The other will be a 4 minute video that demonstrates our app in a high level relatively quick way.
- During the exam hours, the professor will play the 4 minute videos during that time. 
- Adding the finishing touches to test coverage and writing documentation you could finish up during the finals week if we really needed to.
- This week: Try to integrate all the components into the skeleton and start thinking of testing.
- Week 9: Have 1 full time person (maybe even 2) to add some high level testing and also have the code writers write some unit tests as well. Work on unit testing and using Cypress for end-to-end testing as well. 
- This Thursday during our normal meeting: One of the other tutors will be coming for some more UI feedback. Have our current prototype and hi-fi side by side to show them both at the same time. 
- Deepak:"We've been in sync so I don't really have much for you."
- Finish integrating and start working on that one final app instead of working seperately.

- Deepak left at 5:45pm.
- We jumped into our Zoom room for a few other things.

## Our Discussion: 
- Planning Poker/Story points. Going to take some time so we should do this during a separate meeting day. 
- GitHub Project could also work for organization. We all agreed that it would make it easier to visualize. 
- Things we need to get done this week:
  - Storage
  - Finish up the components that are being worked on. 
    - Weekly/Monthly tasks 
    - Tags
  - JSDocs 
  - Code Quality 

- Anything that will be keeping anyone from this class this week:
  - Angel has a poster presentation due next week so he will be working on this throughout this week.
