Brainstorming: 
- While brainstorming we need to think about not just what we want in the end but why. What user pains will we be helping to ease? 
  - We should look into why the original creator of the Bullet Journal created it. What was the first version all about? What purpose did it serve for him? How has it changed since then. 
  - Pen and paper has it's own advantages and disadvantages. What can be solved better using technology? What drawbacks are there to technology?
  - We need to think about why the consumer would use our product. People hire services to sole a particular problemn.
  - Focus on documentation
    - Avoid loss of organizational knowledge.
    - We should be painting a picture of our entire creative process so that anyone else can look at it in the future and see why we made the decisions we did/didn't make. 
    - Document the brainstorming process specifically
      - Analyze progress
      - Go online to look for Bullet Journals, reviews on Amazon for the paper ones and online reviews for online products.
        - While looking at reviews find out what features consumers like? Don't like? Check out people on Youtube who have taken the whole system and tweaked it in their own ways. 


- Document everything!!!
    - Should do a weekly log of what we accomplished in that week. Deepak suggested a Google Doc/folder that we would create into a pdf at the end of the week and add that to our project repo for posterity. 
    - Talk about the process not just the results. Why we decided on certain things and what was suggested as alternatives to what we ended up going with, etc.


Low-fidelity Wireframe is important at our current point.

### Roles we need to discuss assigning today. (Deepak Left at this point ~5:45)
- Documentation: 
  - Issac volunteered to try it out and we decided that tomorrow will be a test run for him during our brainstorming session. We will reassess after that to see if he is comfortable continuing as the documentation role.
