## Deepak:
- Started off by reviewing our pitch and then the high fidelity wireframe.  
  - Pitch
    - Flesh out our user personas some more if possible. Most teams have 4-5 sample users and walk through their problems and how this would fit in. 
    - Storage
      - indexDB
        - web storage options. 
      - localStorage -> JSON 
        - In our case we could probably run everything in the browser and query JSON. Since it is available to one person only we would not have to worry about the size growing too much.

  - High Fidelity
    - Change permissions to be anyone who has the link. 
    - One of us should ping the professor and send him the figma link and see if we could meet to discuss in order to get some feedback.
      - Professor will be able to help us with placement and why they should go there. 
    - Seems very well fleshed out but could use some polish on the UI side. 
    - If we get used to one of these tools like Figma then most of the other tools will share most of the tooling. 
    - Deepak suggests that we update the iconography especially the bullet journal keywords.
    - Work on the spacing, font, coloring. The professor can help with this as well. 
    - 2-3 of us should go talk to the professor. Ask for some feedback on the UX. 
    - Either need to do a 2d or 3d look and feel throughout. Time and key page looks like 3D while the rest is 2D so we need to pick one and use it throughout. 
    - Suggested to move the time and date maybe up into the top right corner since the user will want to see it often. 60% of the current size. That way we could put the cogs and help lower. 
    - In Figma we can link things frame to frame so we could present like an actual app.
    - Goals area is 2D and looks like Android UI. Weekly and Monthly overall buttons looks nicer. 
    - Salmon colored background is usually used as light reminders.
    - The mood slider, either highlight the faces when it hits a certain threshold or just have it so that you can click on one the faces instead. 
    - Add some sort of positive reinforcement like Canvas does when someone finishes a task.
    - Absorb as much as we can from the Professor and try to understand his reasoning so that we could learn. 

## Questions: 

Brian - Q: Is the Thursday meeting recurring? A: Think of it more like an office hour but yes it will be recurring. The main point is to not compare ourselves to other times but rather to absorb the mental model of other's reasoning. Helps to cross pollinate ideas across.

## Important Notes:
- Make some revisions before meeting with the professor. 
  - Add frames
  - Pick 2D/3D 
  - Mood picker potentially instead of the slider. Or highlight the current face as we slide. 
  - Find a symbol pack and make that universally used throughout.
  - Relocate the time. 
  - Try to add some notes for functions to help us further down the road. 
- The rest of us can start working on experimental prototyping.
