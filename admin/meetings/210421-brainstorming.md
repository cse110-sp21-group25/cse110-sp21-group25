## Discussion Items

**Summary:** \
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meeting began with greetings between all team members. The topic for this session was **Brainstorming**. All team members were asked to come prepared to discuss about their individual research on 'Bullet Journals.' The activities of this meeting entailed the following:
  - Lotus Diagram to broad ideas into specific ones.
  - 5 Why's Activity.
  - Discuss and share examples found of analog and/or digital 'Bullet Journals'.
    - Discuss their similarities and differences.
    - Discuss their pros and cons.

## <u> Lotus Diagram Activity </u>
*Concept:* A 'Lotus Diagram,' is a tier-based diagram. Where the broadest idea is placed at its very center and as one traverses to its outer tiers, the ideas grow in specificity.

Our facilitator, **Jesse Wolf**, set up this activity by creating a central 3x3 square which had 1 center block, and 8 outer blocks. He then created a 'frame' of *eight* 3x3 squares surrounding the central 3x3 square. (Refer to the *Miro* screenshots).

To start off this activity, the facilitator placed, **Bullet Journal**, as the center block of the diagram and posed the following questions:
  - What is a 'Bullet Journal'?
  - Why do people do it?

 ## <u> 5 Why’s Activity </u>
*Concept:* A '5 Why's' entails a stair
TRY TO NOT LOOP AROUND OR GO BACKWARDS!

(deleted)
Kevin - 
	TOP - Pushed down
Problem? Can’t get my work done.
	Why? Poor time management

Jesse:
Start with the problem
Determine the problem

Brian: (Watched Video on BoJu)
	Are we trying to solve a problem with the existing journals?

Jesse: 
	Boost productivity by utilizing bullet journal


Simon Liu - Let’s make it more general….

New TOP - Problem? My life is completely unorganized and a hot mess?
	       Why? 
Poor time management
Taking on too much responsibility/tasks
	       Kevin - Lack of motivation. 


Brian - Should we use all 3

Because: I have poor time management and I just don’t care - Voting


Why? I don’t write anything down and my memory sucks so I forget a lot - Brian / Jesse

Delete “memory sucks” - Jesse, can’t really fix that
I don’t write anything down

Because: I used to on sticky notes but I would lose them so cut out the middle man - Brian/Jesse

Why? Did not have a system and just had stickers everywhere so they got lost - Jesse/Brian

Brian - Could not keep track when they were created or due.

Because: there are too many things going on and didn't want to spend the time to get organized. Didn’t believe in amortized cost (Jesse) - Kevin/Brian

Comparison with array - Brian

Why? Never seen the benefits of being organized. - Jesse

Instead only seen what happens when you’re not organized - Brian
Because: Trying to create own system  but it was poorly thought out and took too much time to start up - Simon/Jesse

Why? I wanted a personalized way of staying organized that adapted to my own lifestyle/decisions - Brian

Because: You think that there isn’t a solution already out there that could be adapted to my lifestyle/situation - Brian
Already set up for you. Create the simple system and leave room to customize it. - Brian
Make sure we keep that - Jesse

Root Cause: You never heard of a Bullet Journal - Jesse



Thinking to ourselves being kids:
Why did you say this?
Why did you write that?

Have an example by the next time we meet:

Analog/Digital - One of each

Different type of bullet journals

Amazon physical journal

When do we want to meet again?
Work due monday


Decide when to meet again - https://lettucemeet.com/l/ZvEJl - Everyone fill it out by tonight!

Next time we will go over: Due more brainstorming and finish pros/cons

Jesse - Think about issues, note them on GitHub or Pick a reviewer

Pros and Cons of Analog vs Digital
