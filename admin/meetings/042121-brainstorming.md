## Discussion Items

**Summary:** \
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meeting began with greetings between all team members. The topic for this session was **Brainstorming**. All team members were asked to come prepared to discuss about their individual research on 'Bullet Journals.' The activities of this meeting entailed the following:
  - Lotus Diagram to broad ideas into specific ones.
  - 5 Why's Activity.
  - Discuss and share examples found of analog and/or digital 'Bullet Journals'.
    - Discuss their similarities and differences.
    - Discuss their pros and cons.

## <u> Lotus Diagram Activity </u>
*Concept:* A 'Lotus Diagram,' is a tier-based diagram. Where the broadest idea is placed at its very center and as one traverses to its outer tiers, the ideas grow in specificity.

Our facilitator, **Jesse Wolf**, set up this activity by creating a central 3x3 square which had 1 center block, and 8 outer blocks. He then created a 'frame' of *eight* 3x3 squares surrounding the central 3x3 square. (Refer to the *Miro* screenshots).

To start off this activity, the facilitator placed, **Bullet Journal**, as the center block of the diagram and posed the following questions:
  - What is a 'Bullet Journal'?
  - Why do people do it?

 ## <u> 5 Why’s Activity </u>
*Concept:* A '5 Why's' Activity entailed a 5-tier Q&A process where the root problem is presented at the top tier. Such point, is considered as the 'Point of Entry' to pave the way for discussion and help traverse through the tiers. By addressing the Q&A (Why/Because), the team will traverse through such tiers until finally reaching the **Root Cause** of the problem.

Our facilitator, **Jesse Wolf** introduced the second activity, '5 Why's.' He led the team to attempt to think as if we were developing our *persona* for a prospective candidate that seeks to become more organized and maybe a solution for said individual could be a 'Bullet Journal.'

### Warnings:
**TRY TO NOT LOOP AROUND OR GO BACKWARDS!**

| My life is completely unorganized and a hot mess | Poor time management </br> Taking on too much responsibilities/tasks  </br> Lack of motivation | I have a poor time management and I just don't care | I don't write anything down | I used to write on sticky notes but I would lose them so cut out the middle man | Didn't have a system and just had stickies everywhere so they got lost. Couldn't track when they were created or due. | Because there are too many thing going on and didn't want to spend the time to get organized. Didn't believed in amortized cost. | Never seen the benefits of being organized. Instead only seen what happens when you're not organized | You are trying to create your own system but it was poorly thought out and took too much time to start up | I wanted a personalized way of staying organized that adapted to my own lifestyle/decisions | You think that there isn't a solution already out there that could be adapted to my lifestyle/situation | You never heard of a Bullet Journal |


## Corrections:
Initially we had went with the **Problem** being, "Can't get my work done" </br> 
**Why?** "Poor time management" </br>
 - Simon suggested that we can make it more general
 - This idea was scratched because not much development could be obtained from it. 

Suggested for, Why? #3, I don’t write anything down and my memory sucks so I forget a lot.
 - Jesse suggested to delete “memory sucks. Since, "we can’t really fix that."
  
## Flow:
 - Back and forth suggestions on ideas to fill the blocks
 - Brian posed the question: Are we trying to solve a problem with the existing concept of journals?
 - Decided to use three ideas for Why? #1
 - Formulated concrete ideas thinking and responding as a prospective candidate that could begin to use a 'Bullet Journal.'
 - Reflection on how '5 Why's' was somewhat as ourselves being kids asking:
   - Why did you say this?
   - Our teacher asking: Why did you write that?
 - Finally, we exchanged a few examples of *analog* vs *digital* bullet journals. 

## Ending remarks:
 - Pick up next session discussing our bullet journal's findings
   - Be ready to talk about your finding next meeting
   - Pros and Cons of *analog* vs *digital*
 - Deciding when to meet again (Since work is due on Monday)
   - Decide to meet again through: https://lettucemeet.com/l/ZvEJl - Everyone fill it out by tonight!
