## Discussion Items

**Summary:** \
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meeting began with greetings between all team members. The topic for this session was **Wire-framing**. All team members were asked to come prepared to this meeting. They were ask to develop a rough sketch of their ideal digital BoJu that they would like to implement as a team. They had to include some of the key features that were discussed as a team and provide all members with their design (minimum of three screens) through Google Drive and Miro. 

## Flow:
 - Meeting begins, **Brian Wong** directs the team to begin looking at the compilation of designs created by all team members on Miro. 
 - All team members started to observe the different designs and verbally point out what they liked about each of the designs. 
 - Many of the team members were surprised that most of us included the *key* feature which would give the user easy access to symbols which are not available on the keyboard. 
 - **Brian Wong** then directed the team to focus on the key features they would like for the team's digital BoJu and began to compile such list on a Google Docs document. 
 - Once the list was compiled, all team members were asked to vote on which feature they would like to include in the BoJu.
   - The team voted verbally as each feature was being called out.
 - The team was able to come to an agreement on which features from the list would be attempted to be brought on to the design (tentative list)
   - A discussion opened, voicing concerns on feasibility to attain all of the features given the time constraint.
   - The team agreed that such list was a tentative list and would strive to obtain its key features before moving to the *extra* ones.
 - Team members were asked on what role they wish to partake for the following days and the group ended as such:
   - Low-fidelity Design - Issac Garcia
   - High-fidelity Design - Simon Liu / Issac Garcia / Kevin Wong
   - Pitch - All team members
