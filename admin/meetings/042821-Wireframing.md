## Discussion Items

**Summary:** \
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meeting began with greetings between all team members. The topic for this session was **Wire-framing**. All team members were asked to come prepared to discuss on which ideas should be included in our project, and to begin thinking of ideas on the design and functionalities of such. 

## Flow:
 - Meeting begins and **Jesse Wolf** directs the team to begin thinking about these three questions as a warm-up activity to begin thinking of our low-fidelity design for our BoJu:
  1. Who will be using it?
  2. What is their goal? What problem this product or feature solve for them?
  3. What are some of the actions or operations they are likely to perform? (Workflows).  
- Then as a team we voted on what to use for our low-fidelity design.
  - Figma?
  - Balsamic?
- We created a Google Docs to answer those questions as a team.
- Exchange of ideas, comments, and suggestions consisted on the rest of the meeting (regarding what should go into our BoJu and design).
- Decided that each of us would create a really rough sketch of our ideas and meet next day. 
  - Include at least three windows.


## Team Answers for Intro Questions:

### Questions to ask before Wire-framing:

**Who will be using it?**
- The practical person over the creative. Someone who likes minimalist approach.
- Chad, person who wants everything digital over physical but still wants mostly the same product.
- Journal Skeptic, someone who doesn’t like wasting time writing out all of their thoughts on pages and pages.

**What is their goal? What problem this product or feature solve for them?**
- Get them more organized. Solve their organization problems.
- Allowing them to do so in a timely manner. Not waste more time becoming organized.
- Easily track things, anything they want really. 
- Add some structure into their lives. Bullet Journal everyday and use it as a catch all. 
- Need it to keep themselves accountable or help stay accountable.
- Develop a routine that helps with most of the above. 
- Build some good habits.
- Being able to look back and reflect on what you’ve accomplished and what you may need more work on. 
- Use it as a catchall instead of just another tool to add to the chaos. 
- Offloading information to help with anxiety and be able to look at it super quickly and help to remember those things. 
- Be super easy to use and reliable. 

**What are some of the actions or operations they are likely to perform? (i.e. Workflows)**
- Todo Lists
- General Symbols from Bullet Journal. 
- Being able to jump to the index from all screens. 
- The option of setting a reminder in the morning (asking what time) you would like to be reminded each day. Possibly add more as well.
- Content lock with a option to bypass it but try to have the users fill out their index, yearly and monthly log before starting their first daily log.
