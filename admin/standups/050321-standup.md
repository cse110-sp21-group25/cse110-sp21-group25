## Standup from 3 May 2021

--- 

#### What did you work on since yesterday?
- (Angel) My section for the deliverable
- (Brian) I started the Potential Technical Problems and I mostly fleshed out the rabbit hole for storage.
- (Grady) I feel great after doing my midterms today
- (Issac) I worked on my part for the Pitch which was explaning the why we added a forwards and back button to our implementation as well as their use.
- (Jesse) I worked on elaborating on a lot of the pitch elements with Brian. Started working on the C4 diagram
- (Kevin) High Fidelity wire frames
- (Simon) I worked on the high fidelity wireframe
- (Steven) I worked on my two features for the pitch, described functionalities and usages for the Help and Settings Page.

#### What are you planning on working on today?
- (Angel) Other classes
- (Brian) I plan on fleshing out the Potential Technical Problems some more and help with finalizing the rest of the Starting Pitch.
- (Grady) I was working on the User Personas for our pitching document. I converted the bullet points about our target audiences into a single paragraph that generalizes our users.
- (Issac) I am planning on finishing up last meeting notes (documentation) and continue helping out on the Pitch document.
- (Jesse) Further work on the C4 diagram and helping to get the pitch finished up
- (Kevin) Continue working on High Fidelity
- (Simon) I plan on finishing the high fidelity wireframe, the main page is designed so I am editing copies of that for views of other functionalities of our app
- (Steven) I'm a little unsure about what to work on but then again, I might try to find something to work if I have downtime during work. (6-10PM)

#### Are you stuck somewhere?
- (Angel) No
- (Brian) I'm finding that some of the Potential Technical Problems are overlapping with the rabbit holes in regards to why it might be difficult to do.
- (Grady) I was not stuck at doing that.
- (Issac) Just feel a little stuck on what needs to be done since I was mia yesterday, but I will try and read the chat and see what I can contribute with.
- (Jesse) The C4 diagram is a little weird formatting wise so it's taking me a little while to figure out how to convert our current diagrams to it
- (Kevin) Figma is weird
- (Simon) No, not currently stuck but had questions on how the user is going to edit different parts of our app
- (Steven) Not stuck necessarily but I still need to give myself a task to work on.
