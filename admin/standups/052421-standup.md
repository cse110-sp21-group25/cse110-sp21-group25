## Standup from 24 May 21

--- 

#### What did you work on since yesterday?
- (Angel) Progressed on the tags
- (Brian) I did not work on the project yesterday.
- (Grady) 
- (Issac) The notes for the meeting, and requested the pull for the documentation branch. 
- (Jesse) Got the linter github action simplified and using the config within our repo. Integrated Jest into the pipeline-testing branch, included a sample test within the project/testing directory. Jest should install automatically for everyone once pipeline-testing branch is merged with staging due to the script that runs onFolderOpen previously added. Started setting up Code Climate with the repo.
- (Kevin) I finished the lab, and reviewed a pull request. But I did not get to work on the component.
- (Simon) I finished the lab and met with Jesse to review some pull requests
- (Steven) 

#### What are you planning on working on today?
- (Angel) Work more on the tags
- (Brian) I plan on finishing up the entry editor, storage, and refactor today.
- (Grady) 
- (Issac) I will be completing the CSS for the weekly and monthly module, testing, and hopefully requesting a pull
- (Jesse) I plan on continuing to work on getting Code Climate fully integrated and to discuss with Simon to figure out where to view the JSDocs that are generated and get them pushed/committed to that location upon generation. Also want to have the JSDocs update from within a github action anytime there is a push/pull request from a code heavy branch such as staging.
- (Kevin) I plan on planning my class schedule and spending time on the component today.
- (Simon) I plan on creating the wiki page for our github repo
- (Steven)
