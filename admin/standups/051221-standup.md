## Standup from 12 May 21

--- 

#### What did you work on since yesterday?
- (Angel) Other classes, specifically CSE 101
- (Brian) I implemented the basic funtionality for the navbar.
- (Grady) I met with the group yesterday and talked about the next step of our project
- (Issac) **Out of the office**
- (Jesse) Went to Deepak's meeting as well as class. Worked on further research on linting and found some solid tutorials for getting it seamlessly integrated into VSCode. Ended up fixing the lint test on Github actions as well so that it does check each time anything is pushed (at least in the current pipeline-testing branch). Helped Brian a little bit with regards to setting up the issues on Github for current group tasks.
- (Kevin) Met up with Deepak and team
- (Simon) Read over the introduction to github actions doc, met with Deepak
- (Steven) Primarily worked on other classes, and work

#### What are you planning on working on today?
- (Angel) Finish up the HW for that class, and work on the lab
- (Brian) I'm planning on working on the lab today and maybe converting the navbar into a web component.
- (Grady) I am planning to convert my CodePen features and work with the skeleton template with Kevin
- (Issac) **Out of the office**
- (Jesse) I am planning on finishing up my 101 hw but if I finish that with some time to spare I plan on getting the VSCode linting setup for myself and also figuring out an easy way for everyone else to install it too. Maybe even get started on the pre-commit hook for linter testing.
- (Kevin) Start working on the skeleton with Grady and lab
- (Simon) Find time to further research and catch up to Jesse on CI/CD, potentially meet with him, and work on the lab
- (Steven) Am not planning on working for this class today.

#### Are you stuck somewhere?
- (Angel) Not at the moment
- (Brian) I am not stuck anywhere currently.
- (Grady) Not stuck
- (Issac) **Out of the office**
- (Jesse) Not really stuck, just trying to do adequate research on linting and other github actions before implementing them.
- (Kevin) Nope
- (Simon) No, not yet
- (Steven) Not stuck
