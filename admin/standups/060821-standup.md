## Standup from 8 June 21

---

#### What did you work on since yesterday?

- (Angel) Worked on the documentation
- (Brian) I worked on the storage for the goals-board component.
- (Grady)
- (Issac) I finished the button implementation. Brian will help me adhere it to the weekly/monthly module and started looking over the JSDocs and started commenting some of the components that needed work. Everything is still in my local.
- (Jesse) I reached out to everyone to plan a meeting to discuss video assignments and other lingering assignments. I wrote the initial batch of tests for the mood-indicator, nav-bar and menu-symbols components. Kevin helped me review the mood-indicator tests and Simon helped review the other two. After having some tests to run realized the e2e coverage was not working as I thought and so spent a decent amount of time yesterday fixing that as well. That fix was included in the nav-bar tests and is now integrated into staging.
- (Kevin) I mainly did my cogs project and took some notes for my exam tomorrow.
- (Simon) Worked on testing for quote component as well as my cogs project
- (Steven) I worked on my final and final project for two different classes.

#### What are you planning on working on today?

- (Angel) Getting vaccinated and going to the meeting
- (Brian) I plan on continuing to work on the storage and meet with the team today.
- (Grady)
- (Issac) Finishing as far as I can the JSDocs and begin organizing the teamâ€™s part for the final private video.
- (Jesse) I plan on working on further tests today for any that still need the initial 5 tests and to start the onboarding documentation. Also planning to meet up with the team tonight in order to get started on the videos and other documentation assignments that are due this week.
- (Kevin) Finish up the testing for Editor, and met up with team to make plans for final video.
- (Simon) Finish testing on quote component, meet with the group at 5:30 today
