--- 

#### What did you work on since yesterday?
- (Angel) Finished 101 quizz, and I'll work on 101 hw
- (Brian) I finished commenting my code. I integrated the goals board. I'm still waiting on the tags to be finished before integrating that. I helped Kevin with him and Grady's text-editor.
- (Grady) I worked on the editor with Kevin and finished the new modified mood indicator.
- (Issac) I worked on the lab, and I think I am almost done with it. I also read the documentation page for the FullCalendar API, I will be trying to get something going today at night. 
- (Jesse) Merged a lot of changes into staging with Brian and fixed a decent sized bug in the JSDocs generation. Went to Deepak's large group meeting and got some solid questions answered. Worked on the lab a little but mostly studied for my 101 quiz.
- (Kevin) Finally got 99% of the bullet system together with Grady and Brian. I worked on 101 and studied for the quiz.
