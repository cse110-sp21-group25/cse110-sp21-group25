#### What did you work on since yesterday?

- (Grady) met with the group and discussed the next steps that we should do for the incoming weeks
- (Issac) Added the api into the calendar component with the help from Brian. Edited CSS to have it fit within the mid section. Also got rif of the watermark and began looking on how to add events into the calendar. Will hopefully finish all of it today.

#### What are you planning on working on today?

- (Angel) Probably 101 HW, I tried to drop caffeine this week but withdrawal was kind of rough so yesterday I wasn't able to get much done, today I'll probably be able to focus more on doing my tasks
- (Brian) I plan on working on the local storage and the lab.
- (Grady) I was mostly spending the day finishing up CSE130 and 101 hw and did some modifications so that users can reselect the mood and change to button into question mark for the menu symbols
- (Issac) Finishing the calendar component, seeing how to adhere it or access it through the main structure and do the lab.
- (Jesse) Finishing up my CSE 130 hw and then knocking out some tests for the components that haven't been claimed yet. Helping anyone else where needed as well project wise.
- (Kevin) Continue studying for cogs final tomorrow, working on 101 hw.
