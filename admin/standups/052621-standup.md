## Standup from 26 May 21

--- 

#### What did you work on since yesterday?
- (Angel) On the tags, I now got them to actually work i.e; add them and remove them from the page
- (Brian) I worked more on the entry-editor. It should almost be done.
- (Grady) I did little changes to the text editor yesterday.
- (Issac) I attended the meeting with Deepak but got busy doing my other groupâ€™s project. 
- (Jesse) Finished up the documentation for the second checkpoint for the pipeline. Merged all of the new pipeline features into the staging branch and also main branch. Met with Deepak and the group afterwards.
- (Kevin) I worked on the component with Brian, started implementing bullets. I also met with Deepak
- (Simon) Created the Wiki, made the main components of the Wiki with separate pages of standups, meeting notes, established rules, and team page
- (Steven) 

#### What are you planning on working on today?
- (Angel) I'll try to figure out how to read/write them from a JSON file, rather than a normal array.
- (Brian) I plan on finishing the entry-editor (which includes getting the icons for it). Then maybe I can finally start storage.
- (Grady) I am working on implementing the bullets with Kevin and trying to use a right click to change the bullet points for every entry.
- (Issac) I will check what needs to be done on the issues tab on GitHub and assign a task to work on. 
- (Jesse) Planning on making a dent in the lab and working on getting puppeteer integrated into the pipeline for E2E testing purposes. If time allows I would also like to spend some time working on writing some tests for the components we do have currently.
- (Kevin) I am working on the implementation of bullets and changing them with Grady today. The remaining time I will be working on other classes.
- (Simon) I plan on catching up on other classwork and reach out to Jesse or Brian to see if we need more work on js testing, js docs, or work on coding components
- (Steven)
