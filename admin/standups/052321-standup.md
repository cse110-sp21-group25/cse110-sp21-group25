## Standup from 23 May 21

--- 

#### What did you work on since yesterday?
- (Angel) Finished assignments for other classes
- (Brian) I refactored a bunch of the project's code while trying to add the text editor. (Still haven't added the text editor)
- (Grady) I worked on the lab and other classes
- (Issac) Been MIA due to having to move apartments. I will finish all my responsibilities today. 
- (Jesse) Ended up cleaning up the root quite a bit, added a config folder into the project folder that includes those config files that didn't need to be closer to the actual code. A lot of the previous configs were able to be added within the package.json which was super nice. On a separate branch got the JSDoc generation working via a local command.
- (Kevin) I worked on 101 and the lab
- (Simon) I worked on the lab and met with Jesse to discuss about what we needed to work on
- (Steven) 

#### What are you planning on working on today?
- (Angel) I'll work completely on the tags
- (Brian) I do not plan on working on the project today. I'm probably going to focus on my other classes.
- (Grady) I was planning to play around some web components 
- (Issac) Pushing notes for documentation and completing CSS for weekly and monthly module
- (Jesse) I am planning on reworking the linter in the GitHub workflow so that it will ignore the jsdocs folder. (Currently causing issues when trying to push the jsdocs generated folder.) Also want to have someone else test the current config sometime today to make sure that it doesn't just work on my machine. Will continue to clean up the repository. Once I get the linter reconfigured I also want to get code quality integrated into the pipeline.
- (Kevin) I plan on finishing the lab, finishing up 101, and messing with the journal entry component or any other tasks needed.
- (Simon) I plan on finishing the lab and starting the wiki page for our github repo
- (Steven) 

#### Are you stuck somewhere?
- (Angel) Not at the moment
- (Brian) I am not stuck anywhere currently.
- (Grady) Not stuck
- (Issac) Not currently stuck anywhere. 
- (Jesse) I am sort of stuck until I can get all the current tools working together but I was able to get through a lot of those hurdles yesterday, once they are fully integrated together adding any new ones should be significantly easier then previously.
- (Kevin) Not at the moment
- (Simon) No, not yet
- (Steven)
