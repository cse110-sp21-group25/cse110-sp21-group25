## Standup from 5 June 21

---

#### What did you work on since yesterday?

- (Angel) Studied for 101 final
- (Brian) I wrote a 2 ADRs yesterday and studied for my CSE 105 final.
- (Grady)
- (Issac) I kept studying for my cse 140 midterm and almost finished the lab.
- (Jesse) Ended up not having time to write any tests since I knew if I started I would have gotten sucked in. Spent the whole day instead reviewing for the 101 final today.
- (Kevin)
- (Simon) Didn't get the chance to write tests but worked on the lab and studied for CSE 101 final today
- (Steven) Ended up creating a button on the weekly/monthly module with the purpose of the user being able to switch to the calendar

#### What are you planning on working on today?

- (Angel) Already finished 3 sections of the final, so I'll probably finish the 2 that remain and work on the lab or rest.
- (Brian) I plan on taking both parts of my CSE 105 final
- (Grady)
- (Issac) I will be doing my CSE 140 final midterm and will hopefully finish the lab. I plan to implement the toggle button tonight and maybe add JSDocs comment to my code.
- (Jesse) Cramming a little bit more for 101 and then taking 2 or 3 parts of the final today. If I have a little time tonight might work on testing but probably not.
- (Kevin)
- (Simon) Studying and taking parts of the 101 final
- (Steven) I worked on mostly that today

#### Are you stuck somewhere?

- (Angel) Not at the moment
- (Brian) I am not stuck anywhere currently.
- (Grady)
- (Issac) I need help running tests for my code, and maybe find a way to toggle between the text editor and the calendar.
- (Jesse) No
- (Kevin)
- (Simon) No, not yet
- (Steven) Having a slight problem making everything on the page hidden, will have to work on this more later on
