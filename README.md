## How to Contribute

Step 0) Make sure you have followed the onboarding guide [here](https://github.com/cse110-sp21-group25/cse110-sp21-group25/wiki/Onboarding-Setup) to get your local machine setup properly.

Step 1) Take a look at any issues that are open and if you are working on something that isn't there yet please add that as an issue then assign yourself before starting.

Step 2) Do not ever work directly within the Staging, Pipeline-Testing, or Main branch since you will not be able to push directly to any of those branches. Please make a branch off of one of the prior listed before starting your work.

Step 3) Write JSDoc comments in your code. [Handy Guide](https://devhints.io/jsdoc) See our JSDocs Site [here](https://cujodocs.github.io/CuJoDocumentation/) for example of what this will look like once it is generated as a webpage.

Step 4) If you have worked on the project that day please update the respective issue with details of your progress. This will help not only you keep track of what you've worked on but also the team to be aware of anything that is currently in work and what progress has been made.

Step 5). When creating a pull request please be careful that you are merging to the correct branch, consult above image if you are not completely sure. Also see the GitHub Guide for some helpful screenshots on how to initiate a pull request.

Step 6) Once you have created the pull request please make sure that your issue has been updated and that it closes once the merge is completed.

**Example Workflow:** Let's say I wanted to add a feature to the Mood-Indicator component that animates the faces for added depth. I would create an issue with a brief description of the feature and assign it to myself. Then I would create a branch labeled `mood-indicator-animation` from Staging. At the end of the day I would update the issue with comments of how things are going. Once I was done implementing that new feature I would create a pull request to merge the changes into Staging and make sure to link the issue so that it will be closed once the pull request is merged.
