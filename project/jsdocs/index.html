          <h2>Folder Structure (Given to us via Canvas):</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Overarching Decisions - we will eventually capture these as an ADR
              in markdown (Links to an external site.)(/specs/adrs will contain
              an individual document per major decision. There will be some
              initial ones that have to do with general project plan and
              approach, but more may be added as the project goes on. The main
              point of this capture is to explain why choices are made. As
              brainstorming may have your team settle on choices quickly
              capturing them in a document may be better than just mental
              consensus)
            </li>
            <li>
              User Centered Thinking Documents - we will produce personas (Links
              to an external site.), user stories (Links to an external site.),
              and potentially use cases. (Links to an external site.)
              (/specs/users will contain this but user stories chosen will also
              be represented as issues to work on)
            </li>
            <li>
              Interface Design Documents - we will initially capture &quot;fat
              marker design&quot; later extended with wireframes and high
              fidelity prototypes (/specs/interface/rough,
              /specs/interface/wireframes, /specs/interface/highfidelity These
              directories may contain single or multitude of documents)
            </li>
            <li>
              Project Roadmap - we will capture a roadmap of how the product
              will evolve both here in the quarter as well as ideas of how it
              might grow beyond the time we have with (/specs/roadmap.md)
            </li>
            <li>
              /specs/brainstorm/ will continue the distilled documents and
              diagrams you produced of the ideas you want to capture from your
              meetings. If you used Miro or another tool export the contents as
              an image, PDF, or markdown file to capture your appropriate
              assets.
            </li>
            <li>
              /admin/meetings/mmddyy-brainstorm.md (there may be multiple of
              these) - these are the general meeting notes of the brainstorming
              summarized including attendance, etc. Note this may be more
              exhaustive and procedural as opposed to what will be found in the
              planning document
