## Context and Problem Statement

After using the bullet journal for some time, how will the users be able to quickly able to find a particular idea across their journals? If you have tons of entries it might be difficult to find something you were looking for.
Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question.

## Decision Drivers 

* Minimalistic
* Ease of use, practicality 
* Difficulty of coding

## Considered Options

* Search by keyword
* Search by tags

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Search by tags", because it is the best option that meets our criteria of ease of use and viability. To meet deadlines and produce a Bullet Journal that is quick and easy to use for users, the search tag is a perfect component, providing easy accessibility to previous entries. 

### Positive Consequences 

* Nice little tag for user to organize/categorize their entries 

### Negative Consequences

* May compromise minimalistic approach 

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Search By Keyword
query "birthday" | search for a keyword and all instances of it will pop up

* Good, because can help you find very specific details
* Bad, because it can be very overwhelming and unnecessary if the keyword appears in many instances


### Search By Tag

query #importantDates | search for a tag and all entries with the tag will pop up

* Good, because it greatly reduces the amount of queries and thus should provide a more fast and convenient search bar.
* Good, because not overwhelming to the user, practical
* Bad, because it is not possible to specify exactly what the user is looking for
