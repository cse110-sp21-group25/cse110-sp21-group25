* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Simon Liu, Jesse Wolf, Brian Wong, Kevin Wong
* Date: 05-05-21

## Context and Problem Statement

What was the user going to notice first when looking at their homepage? Did all of the extra clutter need to be there at all times?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Professor mentioned how some users may find it distracting to have tons of elements vying for the user's attention.

## Considered Options

* Remove menus individually (NavBar, Symbol Menu, Goals, Notifications)
* Focus mode that removes all of the extra menus with a single button.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Focus mode", because we had so many extra menus that it might have been annoying to have to click 5 different buttons to remove all of the extra 
elements.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Remove menus individually

[More info](#considered-options)

* Good, because allows the user to customize the page to their liking.
* Bad, because if the user wants to close everything, they will have to close each menu individually.

### Focus mode

[More info](#considered-options)

* Good, because all the unnecessary menus can be hidden at the click of a button.
* Bad, because does not allow any customization in terms of what menus to keep open.

## Links <!-- optional -->

* No links currently.
