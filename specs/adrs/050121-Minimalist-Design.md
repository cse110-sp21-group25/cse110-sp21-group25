Technical Story: [description | ticket/issue URL] <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

Who was our product designed for and how was that going to shape our product's design? We had to think about this question when we were creating low fidelity designs and using those to help guide our starting pitch.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* **Total time to design and create our product**
  * Considering that we only had roughly 5-6 at that point to create this product, we needed to prioritize our features.

## Considered Options

* Have basic functionality with some advanced features and have high customization.
  * Include basic symbol list, customizable symbol list, customizable backgrounds, fonts, colors, and etc.
  * Has calendar view and year view along with their respective logs.
  * Includes search bar and notifications
  * We want the users to be able to customize their BuJo to their heart's content, but still include fleshed out systems.
* Focus mainly on functionality and have minimal or regular amount of customization
  * Include basic symbol list, search bar, notifications, and tags.
  * Calendar and yearly view are included along with the logs.
  * Focus on making the interface very usable rather than customizable
  * We want the users to not spend a lot of time on customization. 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Focus mainly on functionality and have minimal or regular amount of customization", because we decided that we wanted to focus on users that 
priortize functionality. Cutting out customization also helps us complete our product by the deadline. Another reasoning is that the original creator of the bullet 
journal wanted his creation to be quick and easy to use. We wanted to maintain that quality with our bullet journal.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Helps focus our design. That way we can cater to one group well rather than multiple groups poorly.
* Reduces the amount of work to be done.
  * This gives us more time to refine the other features

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Some users may have wanted this level of customization.
* Knowing what to cut and what to keep is kind of difficult.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Have basic functionality with some advanced features and have high customization.
