## ESLint Setup

  1) First go to Extensions within VSCode and install ESLint by Dirk Baeumer.
    a) You will then get a "Failed to load the ESLint library" error. That is totally fine. 
  2) Within your VSCode open up a new Terminal.
     - Once open it should show a path something similar to  
     Mac: `Simons-MacBook-Pro-3:cse110-sp21-group25 simonliu$ `
      or 
     Windows: `~/Documents/UCSD/Spring2021/CSE110/cse110-sp21-group25$` 
     Make sure that you do not have any folders past that.

     **DO NOT RUN THE BELOW COMMANDS IF YOUR PATH DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE EXAMPLES ABOVE.** 
     (If you doubt yourself at all please contact Simon or Jesse and they will help you.)

     Then run the following commands:
       - `npm install eslint`
       - `npm install semistandard`
  3) Find the ESLint icon in the bottom right corner of your screen. Click on that and allow globally.
