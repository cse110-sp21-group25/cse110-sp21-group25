## ESLint Setup

  1) First go to Extensions within VSCode and install ESLint by Dirk Baeumer.
    a) You will then get a "Failed to load the ESLint library" error. That is totally fine we will fix that later. Don't worry about it yet.
  2) Within your VSCode open up a new Terminal. Ren the below commands:
    a) `npm ci`
      This will install a node_modules folder in the origin of your project folder.
  3) Find the ESLint icon in the bottom right corner of your screen. Click on that and select "allow globally".
